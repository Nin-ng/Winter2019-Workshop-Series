Moneyball's Winter 2019 Workshop Series: Predicting MVPs in the MLB

For those of you who may be unaware or are curious about the initial workshop posted. Our club is going through an entire project from start (data collection) to finish (report, blog, communication, etc.). 

This is going to be a project in which anyone can join in on and everyone is encouraged to check out as it will cater to students of all levels as we will start from the very basics and intuition but at the same time provide the resources for more advanced and in depth procedures.  Going through this all step by step. The project will be on predicting the odds of future MVPs of the MLB.

Feel free to reach out to [Jonathan Fernandez](mailto:jonfernandez@ucdavis.edu), [Rohan Malhotra](mailto:rmalhotra@ucdavis.edu) or [Quilvio Hernandez](qahernandez@ucdavis.edu) with any additional questions. (:
